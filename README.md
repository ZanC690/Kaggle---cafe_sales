This is a personal data analysis project done by taking dirty data from Kaggle. 
The steps include:
  1. Inspection - Inspecting the tables for missing or null values.
  2. Dropped non-relevant column, renaming and standardization, and converting values to null before cleaning.
  3. Identified possible mappings between 'item', 'quantity', 'price_per_unit', 'total_spent' to avoid dropping too much data.
  4. Only descriptive statistics are done.
  5. Visualization is in progress because I'm still learning that part.
